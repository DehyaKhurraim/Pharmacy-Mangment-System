# Pharmacy-Mangment-System
The pharmacy management system is a type of management that aims to increase accuracy while also boosting efficiency and safety in the drugstore. It is a computer-based system that assists the pharmacist in managing inventory, costs, medical safety, and other factors. During opening stock and sales operations, the system allows the user to enter the manufacturing and expiry dates for a specific product or drug. Additionally, it requires human entry whenever new batches of medications are received.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide software for the efficient management of a drugstore that can accomplish the following goals: By giving statistics on the drugs in stock and a way to update the database, ensuring effective service and activity monitoring in order to increase system efficiency.
1. To manage the pharmacy's drug inventory as best as possible by keeping an eye on the flow of medications there.
2. To make sure that different functions and roles have different levels of limited access.
3. To make sure the interface is simple to use.
4. To be able to create a view of the customer's ordered medication list.
5. To be able to generate bills after a successful purchase.

Product Scope:
The scope of this project is limited to the activities of a pharmaceutical store which includes will improving health outcomes, reducing hospital and long-term care admissions, enhancing access and care in the Estate and surrounding communities, and ensuring the best use of resources, the use of a computer-based management system for improving the efficiency of a pharmacy is needed and it is an essential part of any modern continuously evolving society. The project's focus is only on the activities of a pharmacy. Drug prescriptions and drug interactions won't be handled by the system. Contraindication and polypharmacy in a prescription will not be handled by the system; this suggests that the pharmacist will need to manually finish these services.

Product Functions:
The Pharmacy Management System is a computer software system that is programmed with the ability to perform different tasks required to operate a pharmacy. They make working easier and allow for the digital record stage and fast retrieval of information. Medical technology is increasing day by day.
The developer uses this opportunity to help the customers in selecting and purchasing the right medicine for the patient. A pharmacy management system is used to buy medicines easily and store the client’s and vendor’s data smoothly. The system is used in superstores and online pharmacies.
